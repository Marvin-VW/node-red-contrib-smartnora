This module provides a set of nodes in Node-RED for Google smart home Action integration via [Smart NORA](https://smart-nora.eu/).

## Features
- support for multiple devices/traits (On/Off, Brightness, Color, Open/Close, etc.) and many more to come
- local execution path to reduce latency to a minimum
- web push notifications to mobile devices so you don't need yet another service to be informed about the important things
- better performance with capability of scaling up for tens of thousands of users

## Setup

[Here's a short guide](./doc/setup/README.md) on how to get started with Smart NORA.

## Supported nodes

[Here's a list](./doc/nodes) and documentation on the supported nodes. 
If a device that you want is not on the list, you can [create a new discussion](https://github.com/andrei-tatar/node-red-contrib-smartnora/discussions/new) to discuss it. Contributions are appreciated, especially around the node-red configuration node code (html file) and documentation.
